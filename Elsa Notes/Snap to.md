- get pos of mouse
	- get_viewport().get_mouse_position()
- get pos of sprite. 
	- var = get_node("node_name")
	- pos = get_position(var)
	- But get_position() get the position of the child compared to the parent. So in our case we have to do this in Main script instead of its own. .... as far as i know so far. 
- Compare the two pos's if in a given range, snap one to other.
